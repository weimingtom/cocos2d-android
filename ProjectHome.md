## News ##

I've decided to resume my work on cocos2d android engine. I've tried a few scene graphs & graphics libraries for a while (even tried html5) but nothing seems to be doing what I want to use in the new game I am currently building. cocos2d remains the best solution for developing 2d games and animations and android phones are great to play games too!

If you are interested to help, please don't hesitate to send me a request, give a donation so I can work more hours on this project or even send a mail saying 'hi' and send your suggestions, please don't hesitate!

Happy hacking & gaming!

## About ##

cocos2d for Android is a framework for building 2D games, demos and other graphical/interactive applications. It is based on the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/cocos2d-iphone/'>cocos2d-iphone</a> design: it uses the same API, but instead of using objective-c, it uses Java.
